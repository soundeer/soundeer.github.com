                    </a><div id="item-description"><p>The Press:</p><p>"The only way to describe The Dewars would be to imagine The Proclaimers and David Bowie getting together to write music for the circus... These Floridians traveled a long way to arrive in Vancouver, but clearly won over the unfamiliar early crowd. Their upbeat 70’s pop seemed to brighten the mood of the whole crowd and by the end of the set had everyone dancing." ~ Mitchell Black (Vancouver Music Culture)</p><p>"Twin brothers Anthony and Zachary Dewar led their six-piece group through dark-humored songs, whose lyrics ranged from “ Life is like a merry-go-round till the burial ground” to musings on the apocalypse, all set to an upbeat, Decemberists-like, old-timey folk sound. By the end of the performance, listeners might have walked away humming the catchy refrain to the group’s song “Pedophile Pete.”" ~<br /></p><p>"The Dewars mash feel good grooves with 60's Syd Barret/Pink Floyd and 90's style rock, convoluted I know, but they put on a great show. Especially with the banter between the space cadet twin boys." -<br /></p><p>"The Dewars... casually took on serious themes in songs like the self-explanatory opener, "Life is Like a Merry-Go-Round Until the Burial Ground," and its anti-capitalist follow-up, "Bulls and Bears." The refrain of another song asks, "If the world was gonna end today/What would you say?" The Dewars, I'd imagine, would suggest that you just sing along while they provide the soundtrack with their indie-rock barnyard stomps." ~ Nick Murray (The Village Voice)</p><p>"Next up was this incredibly weird band called The Dewars. Like, they've got to be the oddest band I've ever seen live. The group is fronted by the Dewar Brothers, who had matching glasses and excessively geeky looks. Their most notable backing members included a Rasputin-esque maraca shaker &amp; an insane keyboard player who moved like a nerd version of Peter Murphy, throwing bedroom eyes and sweat at everyone. Video was the only way to capture this odd group." ~ Jiff (Unpopularized Culture)</p><p>"The Dewars spoke as if they were from the 1920s and in an odd British type of accent. Which I gotta admit was humorous. Their music was interesting, to say the least. They sounded like a grunge version of The Kinks mixed with Dr. Dog." ~ Melissa Culbertson (The Journal)</p><p>"If I hadn’t been spending all my time trying to simulate fellatio with my dollar bills to get the fierce bartender’s attention, I may have missed the dreamy weirdo-pop madness of The Dewars. They have a huge collection of songs that display their vast influences, including tinges of Elephant Six bands like Beulah and Olivia Tremor Control." ~ Adam G. (The Deli)</p><p>"If you'd looked around Neurolux last night for the most awkward and unlikely people to even see at a rock show, you'd probably have settled on The Dewars, a pair of wild-haired, "comfortably" dressed oddballs. The Dewar Brothers' sounds and arrangements have a British-invasion style of clean guitar rock—they even put on faux-British accents for some stage banter—but their songwriting style owed more to indie-folk." ~ Josh Gross (Boise Weekly)</p><p>"Surfer Blood and the Dewars put on such enjoyable shows and I particularly think myself fortunate to have seen them together. I actually listen to these bands’ CDs and am glad Surfer Blood brought the Dewars with them so that I, and the other audience members, could be introduced to something this special." ~ Dagmar (Back Beat Seattle)</p><p>"The twin brothers sound like melodic Lou Reeds, with Leonard Cohen’s mind and a splash of Florida sun. They give us wholesome mellow rock without repetition, clean guitars, strings and uplifting drum splashes. It’s mood rock and it’s meant to get you engaged with shimmering voices to remind you of the swaying afternoon waves. Take Sweet Bronco, The Jameses and The Dewars and I dare say South Florida is primed with some kick-ass unique sounds. “Sunshine” is the oddest summer tune of the year" ~<br /></p><p>"From the moment the Dewar brothers took the stage and opened with "Life is Like a Merry Go Round Until the Burial Ground," it was clear that they had ample personality and presence. There were some immediate and obvious touchstones to the music, from the eccentric, broken lyrical and musical phrasings of the Fall to the silly, sometimes inspired, playfulness of They Might Be Giants. A number of the songs also evoked Robyn Hitchcock's solo material, as well as Pulp -- but without sounding like any of that.</p><p>At one point during their set, the Dewar Brothers informed us that the place they're from is "a really good place to die" and then played "The Neverglades." This sort of sardonic, dark, offbeat sense of humor characterized the band's banter between songs, even when one of the guitars malfunctioned and one of the brothers awkwardly told bad jokes, knowing full well they were lame but somehow managing to win us over anyway.</p><p>If nothing else, The Dewars proved themselves to be a compelling band whose penchant for colorful storytelling only added to their already considerable charm as performers fully capable of laughing at themselves as part of the fun. You have to have a sense of humor, apparently, to survive being a band like this in West Palm Beach, Florida." ~ Tom Murphy (Westword, Denver)</p><p>BAND OF THE DAY (8.11.10) THE DEWARS</p><p>"South Florida strikes again... twin bros, who sound like melodic Lou Reeds, with Leonard Cohen’s mind and a splash of Florida sun. They give us wholesome mellow rock without repetition, clean guitars, strings and uplifting drum splashes. It’s mood rock and it’s meant to get you engaged with shimmering voices to remind you of the swaying afternoon waves. Take Sweet Bronco, The Jameses and The Dewars and I dare say South Florida is primed with some kick-ass unique sounds. “Sunshine” is the oddest summer tune of the year" ~<br /></p><p>GLIMPSES OF THE SOUTH FLORIDA SCENE: THE DEWARS</p><p>"West Palm's the Dewars are clouded in dreamy mystery... their songs are psychedelic, mildly nautical, acoustic affairs. Given the enigmatic nature of their music and their attitudes about songwriting itself, the title of their upcoming release, Songs From the Neverglades, is especially fitting - Anthony and Zachary Dewar are purveyors of a swampy, bluesy Florida that exists only in aural fairytales." ~ New Times</p><p>DEAD CONFEDERATE INTERVIEW</p><p>"And there’s this band called The Dewars, they’re twin brothers, and we played with them down in Florida. They gave me their record. It has 22 songs on it, and they’re all awesome. It’s whacked-out, folky Syd Barrett-meets-The Beatles and Bob Dylan-meets-something-really-new, too." ~ Hardy Morris (Dead Confederate)<br /></p><p>SURFER BLOOD TWITTER</p><p>"The Dewar Brothers are my favorite songwriters." ~ Thomas F. (Surfer Blood)</p><p>WEIRD WIVES BLOG</p><p>"The Dewars are a lot like The Addams Family... they are a family with so many odd little qualities you can't help but be fascinated by the way they interact with the world outside." ~ Weird Wives Blog</p><p>MOODVANE</p><p>"I finally saw twin brother-fronted The Dewars perform last Wednesday night at the oil spill benefit show. They were nothing less than phenomenal. I’ve got to get deeper into their recordings. I need time to digest what I’ve already seen... I wish that I were a Surfer Blood fan in a faraway town so that I could go to the concert with no expectations for the opening band and get my mind blown by the twinsy trippiness of The Noise Boys." ~Mood Vane</p><p>released 30 August 2010</p></div></div><div class="item-header span6"><img src="http://208.111.39.207/soundeer-assets/media/photologue/photos/cache/f0.bcbits.com_z_63_23_632320442-1_cover_medium.jpg" alt="Songs From The Neverglades band" title="Songs From The Neverglades by The Dewars" width="250px" height="250px" /></div></div></div><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
