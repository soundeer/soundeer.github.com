The much maligned genre is the dumping ground for basically any band that plays without vocals nowadays, and a lot of bands are quite vocal about not wanting it tagged to their creative outlet. So I'm all for Pan claiming it, even if its tongue in cheek. Their debut EP is titled Post Rock Is Not Dead, and it finds an amazing middle ground between the ebullient, effortlessly fun sounds of Fang Island with the grandiose sounds of obvious touchstones Explosions In The Sky - and there isn't much in the way of grandstanding, posturing or pilfering to be found. Its a solid release all round, and seeing as I love me my instrumentals, that is an infinitely good thing!"</p><p>Sonic Masala -<br /></p><p>“From South Carolina comes 5 guys pumping out tasty and up-beat post rock. They mix it with 90's style indie rock and keep the songs fairly short so no parts ever feel overdone. It's good music to listen to on a cloudy day; it'll make you feel triumphant about anything you want. This EP is available for free from bandcamp and it looks like they are planning a full length release sometime soon. ”</p><p>Sometimes I Get Drunk at Night -<br /></p><p>“This 7-song ep is sweet, simple and easy on the ears. Initially, I was frustrated at the lack of vocals, but, in the end, it wins hearts. The title couldn’t be more fitting. Skinny drums sound like pristine home recordings and, delightfully, with snares that are warm and dissipating instead of ringing and abrupt (something that annoys me about some post-rock bands). Guitars are layered without trickery or complication, and bass is merged within them as a proper frequency placeholder. The whole sound reminds me of Thursday nights in the late 90s – of bands like Slingshot Episode and Hot Water Music, but with some smoother transitional elements (like The Get Up Kids sometimes adopted), that really allow the record to flow and leads to humbly shine.”</p><p>Janey Criss -<br /></p><p>“This is a real fun record! It's like Post-Rock mixed with Fang Island which is absolutely badass! I love that childish touch it has if you know what I'm trying to say. These guys definitely how to build that up to huge walls.”</p><p>Music As Heroin -<br /></p><p>“Columbia's Pan boasts Post Rock is Not Dead on its new EP. The music backs up the claim: Explosions in the Sky acolytes will love the group's soaring walls of textured guitars, but its tremendous energy will sweep up rock fans of other stripes as well.”</p><p>J. Lawrence -<br /></p><p>“South Carolina's very own Pan is often mentioned in the same breath as Post-Rock juggernauts, Explosions in the Sky or Godspeed You! Black Emperor. But if one were to make a more accurate assessment of this instrumental powerhouse, it would be to dub them innovators of Post-Post Rock. An eclectic combination of sound and fervor”</p><p>Fr. Jones -<br /></p><p>“Lead by a twin guitar onslaught and fortified by an airtight rhythm section, the band resists the urge to fill every moment with a barrage of notes, opting instead to explore tension and release to great effect, as Pan's songs drift from epic passages of sublime beauty to crushing assaults of melodic intensity. And they've got the chops to match their formidable composition skills, which are complex but never condescending. You don't need a degree in Advanced Music Theory to enjoy Pan. Two ears in good working order will do. Oh, and a hand for throwing goat. You're gonna need it.”</p><p>Mike Jones -<br /></p><p>“Pan's debut EP, Post Rock Is Not Dead, in its three songs, offers something of a mission statement for the band. The title itself is telling. Pan shows a real effort to move its instrumental songs as far from self-serious austerity as possible. The band keeps things upbeat with aggressive guitar melodies not too far removed from punk-metal bands like Strung Out, and a dance-rock lilt in “Seeking (The Sea King)” that suggests Ratatat. The panoramas this band paints don’t languish in a gloomy grayscale, but splash bright colors across the canvas.”</p><p>B. Reed -<br /></p><p>"Bring your earplugs to this one. Columbia’s Pan carries with it a sound too large for a mere rock club to contain. In fact, there might be some arenas that would be found lacking. Its post-rock is enormous, bursting forth with heroically chugging riffs that soar with relentless energy. Layers build up patiently and then crash down in gripping catharsis. Who needs words? There’s enough feeling in these mighty instrumentals to satisfy any emotive need."</p><p>J. Lawrence -<br /></p><p>“If Mogwai is Beethoven, this band is Bach”</p><p>fan</p><p>released 28 March 2011
